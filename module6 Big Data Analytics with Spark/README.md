# Module 6: Big Data Analytics with Spark

## Scenario

In this assignment you will download the search term data set for the e-commerce web server and run analytic queries on it.

## Objectives

You will perform a number of tasks to analyze search terms on the e-commerce web server. You will work in Watson Studio within a Jupyter notebook to run your analysis against a CSV file containing the webserver data. You will load this file into a Spark data frame and print the results of your queries against this data set. You will then load a pre-trained sales forecasting model and use this to predict the sales for next year.

## Tools / Software

Spark

### Step 1: Download The search term dataset from the below url
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/Bigdata%20and%20Spark/searchterms.csv

### Step 2: Load the csv into a spark dataframe

### Step 3: Print the number of rows and columns

### Step 4: Print the top 5 rows

### Step 5: Find out the datatype of the column searchterm?

### Step 6: How many times was the term `gaming laptop` searched?

### Step 7: Print the top 5 most frequently used search terms?

### Step 8: Download the pretrained sales forecasting model is available at the below url  
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/Bigdata%20and%20Spark/model.tar.gz

### Step 9: Load the sales forecast model.

### Step 10: Using the sales forecast model, predict the sales for the year of 2023.
