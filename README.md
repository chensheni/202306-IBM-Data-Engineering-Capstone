Big data platform - Hadoop
Big data analytics platform – Spark
Business Intelligence Dashboard - IBM Cognos Analytics
Data Pipelines - Apache Airflow
 
In this Capstone project, I Designed a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Designed and implemented a data warehouse and generated reports from the data. Designed a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. Extracted data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transformed it and loaded it into the data warehouse, and then created an ETL pipeline. And finally, created a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deployed a machine learning model.

In Module 1, design the OLTP database for an E-Commerce website, populate the OLTP Database with the data provided and automate the export of the daily incremental data into the data warehouse. 

In Module 2, set up a NoSQL database to store the catalog data for an E-Commerce website, load the E-Commerce catalog data into the NoSQL database, and query the E-Commerce catalog data in the NoSQL database. 

In Module 3, design the schema for a data warehouse based on the schema of the OLTP and NoSQL databases. Then create the schema and load the data into fact and dimension tables, automate the daily incremental data insertion into the data warehouse, and create Cubes and Rollups to make the reporting easier. 

In Module 4, create a Cognos data source that points to a data warehouse table, create a bar chart of Quarterly sales of cell phones, create a pie chart of sales of electronic goods by category, and create a line chart of total sales per month for the year 2020. 

In Module 5, extract data from OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases into CSV format. Then transform the OLTP data to suit the data warehouse schema and then load the transformed data into the data warehouse.

In the sixth and final module, use skills in Big Data Analytics to create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model on SparkML for making sales projections.
